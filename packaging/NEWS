pushpin (1.38.0-0) experimental; urgency=medium

  With version 1.38.0, upstream bundles condure with pushpin, named
  pushpin-condure. Therefore, an external condure or mongrel2 binary
  is no longer used.

pushpin (1.31.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  With version 1.31.0, upstream defaults to using condure instead of
  mongrel2. (https://github.com/fanout/condure/)

  As this is not yet packaged for debian, we can't simply
  adopt that approach. Instead, we use a slightly more complex migration
  strategy:

  For new installations, we check if a condure binary is in the path.
  If it is, we install a config file referring to condure, otherwise we
  use mongrel2.

  For upgrades of existing installations, the current selection from
  pushpin.conf is preserved.

  If you want to switch to condure, first install it (from source,
  future debian/ubuntu packages, or the packages provides by
  upstream, https://pushpin.org/docs/install/#debian-and-ubuntu).

  Then, replace mongrel2 and m2adapter with condure in pushpin.conf.

pushpin (1.9.0-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  The file /etc/default/pushpin is not used any more.

  Pushpin is now started by default. If you disabled pushpin using
  RUN=no before, please disable it using your init system. For example,
  with systemd, you could run "systemctl disable pushpin".

pushpin (1.6.0-1~) fanout; urgency=medium

  For the fanout repository on bintray, the updates check which
  was disabled in debian version 1.2.0-1 gets enabled by default.

pushpin (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Pushpin 1.2.0 contains a new feature which checks for updates daily
  and reports new versions to the logfile.

  Upstream enables this feature by default, but in Debian, it's disabled
  for privacy reasons.

  You can enable the feature in /etc/pushpin/pushpin.conf by
  setting updates_check=true
