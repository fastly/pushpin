HTTP Extensible Pubsub Control Protocol (EPCP)
----------------------------------------------

This protocol defines a generalized and extensible way of publishing data
through a publish-subscribe service using HTTP. A pubsub service offering an
EPCP interface must make a REST API available at a known base URI.

For example, if the base URI of the EPCP service is
http://localhost:9000/epcp, then method endpoints would be appended onto
that. For example, the "publish" endpoint would be available at
http://localhost:9000/epcp/publish/

Publishing:

POST {base-uri}/publish/{channel}/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": str,
      "prev-id": str,
      format_1: {},
      format_2: {},
      ...
    },
    ...
  ]
}

More than one item may be published in a single request. Each item may contain
one or more formats by providing field names for each format along with their
values. Item formats may be specified in further specifications. EPCP alone
does not define any item formats.
