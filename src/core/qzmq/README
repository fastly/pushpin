QZmq
----

Author: Justin Karneges <justin@fanout.io>

Yet another Qt binding for ZeroMQ. It wraps the C API of libzmq. It is
compatible with libzmq versions 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x.

Some features:
  - Completely event-driven, with both read and write notifications.
  - For convenience, it is not necessary to create a Context explicitly. If a
    Socket is created without one, then a globally shared Context will be
    created automatically.
  - Some handy extra classes. For example, RepRouter makes it easy to write a
    REP socket server that handles multiple requests simultaneously, and Valve
    makes it easy to regulate reads.

To build the examples:

  echo "LIBS += -lzmq" > conf.pri
  qmake && make

To include the code in your project, just use the files in src. From a qmake
project you can include src.pri. It's your responsibility to link to libzmq.
